# ESWC-16 Conference Live app Challenge
This folder contains guidelines and materials for the Conference Live app Challenge at ESWC 2016.

In the past two years the Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) has provided a semantic Web application to browse conference data. 
The application, called Conference Live, is a Web and mobile application based on conference data from the Semantic Web Dog Food server, which provides facilities to browse papers and authors at a specific conference. The data-backend is provided by the metadata chairs, while the front-end application has been developed by different teams for [ESWC2014](http://oak.dcs.shef.ac.uk/eswc2014) and [ESWC2015](http://oak.dcs.shef.ac.uk/eswc2015). In this challenge we call for a front-end application for ESWC2016. The task consist in implementing a system that allows the navigation of ESWC-16 semantic metadata. The system should satisfy specific requirements indicated in the call. The metadata chairs provide:

- data which is enriched with social features (e.g. integrated Twitter accounts of paper authors), scheduling features (calendar information are attached for paper presentations and social events)
- a backend service to vote for publications, if the conference includes sessions where participants can vote, as it is popular e.g. for poster and demo sessions.
