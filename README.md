# ESWC-16 Conference Live app Challenge
=========

This folder contains guidelines and materials for the Conference Live app Challenge at ESWC 2016.

In the past two years the Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) has provided a semantic Web application to browse conference data. 
The application, called Conference Live, is a Web and mobile application based on conference data from the Semantic Web Dog Food server, which provides facilities to browse papers and authors at a specific conference. The data-backend is provided by the metadata chairs, while the front-end application has been developed by different teams for [ESWC2014](http://oak.dcs.shef.ac.uk/eswc2014) and [ESWC2015](http://oak.dcs.shef.ac.uk/eswc2015). In this challenge we call for a front-end application for ESWC2016. The task consist in implementing a system that allows the navigation of ESWC-16 semantic metadata. The system should satisfy specific requirements indicated in the call. The metadata chairs provide:

- data which is enriched with social features (e.g. integrated Twitter accounts of paper authors), scheduling features (calendar information are attached for paper presentations and social events)
- a backend service to vote for publications, if the conference includes sessions where participants can vote, as it is popular e.g. for poster and demo sessions.


**Submissions** will consist of:
1. A **summary** description (abstract) of up to 200 words;
2. A **paper** presenting the details of the implemented method, which discusses its novelty (if applicable), and highlights its strengths and weaknesses;
3. **Web Access**: the Web application must be fully implemented and the code must be accessible either via the Web (e.g github) or downloadable. In particular, the application should be:
- Open Source
- compatible with [Cordova framework](https://cordova.apache.org/)


Important Dates
=========

- Challenge **papers** and **systems** submission deadline: Friday March 11th, 2016
- Challenge paper **reviews due**: Tuesday April 5th, 2016
- **Notifications** sent to participants: Friday April 8th, 2016
- Final ESWC 2016 data published (for final test of the winning system): Friday April 8th, 2016
- **Camera ready** papers due: Sunday April 24th, 2016â€‹


The **Notification** will already declare the winning system, which will be distributed by [Conference Live](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Conference+Live) as the official ESWC-16 App. 
If a winning system cannot be proclaimed (e.g. all submissions fail to meet the minimum requisites) the metadata chair will provide a Conference Live baseline system.
